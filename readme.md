## ‚ùØ Why another middleware for express to work with correlation ids?

> These packages are a combination of observations and experiences we have had with other middlewares which we tried to improve.

1. üé® Customized correlation ids: sometimes one needs to customize correlation ids. For instance adding prefix based on the incoming request
2. üçï Forwarding correlation ids: oftentimes an incoming correlation id needs to be forwarded as a header to another request convienently
3. üèÑüèª Opting out of correlation ids: cases exist where a correlation id can not be generated while the fact should be logged
4. üëåüèº Inspecting correlation ids: the correlation id of a request should be easy to extract without knowing the specific header

## ‚ùØ Installation

Depending on the preferred package manager use:

`yarn add @commercetools/express-request-correlator`

or

`npm i @commercetools/express-request-correlator --save`

## ‚ùØ Documentation

The `express-request-correlator` comes with a couple of options it can be configured with:

- `headerName`: the name of the header which a new correlation id will be set on. Defaults to `X-Correlation-Id`
- `generateId`: a function called whenever an incoming request does not have a correlation id. Receives the `request` within its options argument

An example configuration would be:

```js
const {
  createRequestCorrelatorMiddleware,
} = require('@commercetools/express-request-correlator');

app.use(createRequestCorrelatorMiddleware());
```

Configuring the middleware on your express application exposes a `correlator` property on each request. This property exposing the following API:

```js
getCorrelationId(): TCorrelationId,
getHeaderName(): string,
forwardCorrelationId({ headers }: TForwardCorrelationIdOptions): TCorrelationId
```

1. If for instance you need to retrieve the current request's correlation id invoke `request.correlator.getCorrelationId()`.
2. If you want to forward the correlation id to another request's headers run `request.correlator.forwardCorrelationId({ headers })`
   - This will mutate the passed in headers to contain the previous request's correlation id

## ‚ùØ Testing

In case you want to create a test correlator you can use the `createRequestCorrelatorMock` export. It will create a mocked correlator with the same API as the acutal correlator.
