## ‚ùØ Why another middleware for express to work with correlation ids?

> These packages are a combination of observations and experiences we have had with other middlewares which we tried to improve.

1. üé® Customized correlation ids: sometimes one needs to customize correlation ids. For instance adding prefix based on the incoming request
2. üçï Forwarding correlation ids: oftentimes an incoming correlation id needs to be forwarded as a header to another request convienently
3. üèÑüèª Opting out of correlation ids: cases exist where a correlation id can not be generated while the fact should be logged
4. üëåüèº Inspecting correlation ids: the correlation id of a request should be easy to extract without knowing the specific header

## ‚ùØ Installation

Depending on the preferred package manager use:

`yarn add @commercetools/express-request-correlator`

or

`npm i @commercetools/express-request-correlator --save`

## ‚ùØ Concepts

A correlation id, also known as a unique identifier that is attached to requests that allow reference to a particular transaction or event chain. In the case of multiple microservices it is used to correlate an incoming request to other resulting requests to other services. As a result a correlation ID should be passed on as soon as found on an incoming request. If not found it should be generated as soon as possible to have a correlatable request chain as early as possible. Ultimatively this helps enabling a concept called distributed tracing in a distributed system.

Usually correlation ids are passed as a header. The specific name of that header differs. Often `X-Correlation-Id` is used. Generally multiple services in a fleet/architecture should agree on a shared name and location (e.g. header) of the id. However, it is possible that service A makes a request with a correlation id named (`X-Request-Id`) to service B which forwards it as `X-Correlation-Id`.

## ‚ùØ Documentation

The `express-request-correlator` comes with a couple of options it can be configured with:

- `headerName`: the name of the header which a new correlation id will be set on. Defaults to `X-Correlation-Id`
- `generateId`: a function called whenever an incoming request does not have a correlation id. Receives the `request` within its options argument

An example configuration would be:

```js
const {
  createRequestCorrelatorMiddleware,
} = require('@commercetools/express-request-correlator');

app.use(createRequestCorrelatorMiddleware());
```

1. The middleware adds a correlation id to each response onto its header
   - The previously received ID is forwarded/used or a new id is generated
2. The middleware itself exposes a property called `correlator` (more below) onto each incoming request
   - This object allows receiving the correlation id in other parts of the request chain

Configuring the middleware on your express application exposes a `correlator` property on each request. This property exposing the following API:

```ts
type TMiddlewareOptions = {
  headerName: string,
  generateId: (options: TGenerateIdOptions) => TCorrelationId,
};
type TCorrelationId = string | null;
type TGetCorrelationIdOptions = {
  ifNotDefined?: ({
    generateId: $PropertyType<TMiddlewareOptions, 'generateId'>,
  }) => TCorrelationId,
};
type TForwardCorrelationIdOptions = {
  headers: $PropertyType<express$Request, 'headers'>,
  ifNotDefined?: $PropertyType<TGetCorrelationIdOptions, 'ifNotDefined'>,
};

getCorrelationId(): TCorrelationId,
getHeaderName(): string,
forwardCorrelationId({ headers }: TForwardCorrelationIdOptions): TCorrelationId
```

1. If for instance you need to retrieve the current request's correlation id invoke `request.correlator.getCorrelationId()`.
2. If you want to forward the correlation id to another request's headers run `request.correlator.forwardCorrelationId({ headers })`
   - This will mutate the passed in headers to contain the previous request's correlation id

Note, that `getCorrelationId` and `forwardCorrelationId` both accept a object with configuration:

```js
{
  ifNotDefined: () => TCorrelationId;
}
```

Whenever `ifNotDefined` is passed it is used to generate a new correlation ID given the request does not already have one. Whenever `ifNotDefined` is not passed the "globally" configured `generate` function will be used if not correlation ID is present on the request.

## ‚ùØ Testing

In case you want to create a test correlator you can use the `createRequestCorrelatorMock` function on the `testUtils` object. It will create a mocked correlator with the same API as the acutal correlator.

```js
const { testUtils } = require('@commercetools/express-request-correlator');

testUtils.createRequestCorrelatorMock();
```
